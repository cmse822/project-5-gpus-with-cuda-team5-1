In this folder, we have the difference between the host kernel, cuda kernel and cuda shared memory kernel performances for fixed timesteps. 

The plotting has been done using the `plotting.py` file in the main directory. The plots starting with `fig1` prefix are the difference between cuda and host
kernels. 
And `fig2` prefixed files are the difference between all 3 kernels.
